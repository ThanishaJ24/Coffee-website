        <p style="margin-top:50px">
            In the 15th century, people used their manual spice grinders or grain mills to grind coffee. The first coffee mill, made specifically to grind coffee beans, was invented by Englishman Nicholas Book in the late 17th century. Coffee was placed in the top of the lever device and was grinded into a bottom drawer.

            One of the most satisfying yet frustrating aspects of home brewing is seeking to master the art of grinding. I have often thought that one of the quintessential joys of coffee is that moment when you walk into your favourite cafe and are hit by the aroma of freshly roasted and freshly ground beans. And the amazing thing is that you can, at least in part, replicate that experience in your own kitchen!
        </p>
        <p>We have sought to make this article a comprehensive guide to home coffee grinding. We will cover everything from grind size for different brewing methods, to different types of grinders, to the technical relationship between grinding and extraction. So whether you are new to the game or just getting some tips and reminders we hope you find it helpful.</p>
        <h3>Why Should You Grind Your Own Coffee?</h3>
        <p>So is it worth the hassle? There are an abundance of speciality roasters that now offer pre-ground beans delivered straight to your doorstep, so is it worth taking the leap and grinding from home? Well the fact that you are reading this article is definitely a step in the right direction and possibly an indicator that you are at least considering it. And we think that the answer is absolutely. There are basically two massive advantages of grinding your own beans; fresher coffee and the freedom to experiment.</p>

    <h3>Grinding method</h3>
       <ol>
    <h3><li>Burr-grinding</li></h3>
        <p>Burr mills use two revolving abrasive elements, such as wheels or conical grinding elements, between which the coffee beans are crushed or "torn" with little frictional heating. The process of squeezing and crushing of the beans releases the coffee's oils, which are then more easily extracted during the infusion process with hot water, making the coffee taste richer and smoother.</p>
            <p>Both manually and electrically powered mills are available. These mills grind the coffee to a fairly uniform size determined by the separation of the two abrasive surfaces between which the coffee is ground; the uniform grind produces a more even extraction when brewed, without excessively fine particles that clog filters.</p>
        <p>These mills offer a wide range of grind settings, making them suitable to grind coffee for various brewing systems such as espresso, drip, percolators, French press, and others. Many burr grinders, including almost all domestic versions, are unable to achieve the extremely fine grind required for the preparation of Turkish coffee; traditional Turkish hand grinders are an exception.</p>
        <p>Burr grinders are of two types - conical burrs and flat wheel burrs. Both of them grind coffee bean consistently and with uniform size. Almost every burr coffee grinder grinds at low noise, offer large hopper for storing whole coffee bean, easy to use with portafilter for espresso grind, body made with stainless steel or ceramic with modern design as well as slow operating system ensures fine grind all the time.</p>
        <h3><li>Chopping</li></h3>
        <p>Coffee beans can be chopped by using blades rotating at high speed (20,000 to 30,000 rpm), either in a blade grinder designed specifically for coffee and spices, or in a general use home blender. Devices of this sort are cheaper than burr grinders, but the grind is not uniform and will produce particles of widely varying sizes, while ideally all particles should have the same size, appropriate for the method of brewing. Moreover, the particles get smaller and smaller during the grinding process, which makes it difficult to achieve a consistent grind from batch to batch.</p>
        <p>Blade grinders create “coffee dust” that can clog up sieves in espresso machines and French presses, and are best suited for drip coffee makers. They are not recommended for grinding coffee for use with pump espresso machines.</p>
        <h3><li>Pounding</li></h3>
        <p>Arabic coffee and Turkish coffee require that the grounds be almost powdery in fineness, finer than can be achieved by most burr grinders. Pounding the beans with a mortar and pestle can pulverise the coffee finely enough.</p>
        <h3><li>Roller grinding</li></h3>
        <p>In a roller grinder, the beans are ground between pairs of corrugated rollers. A roller grinder produces a more even grind size distribution and heats the ground coffee less than other grinding methods. However, due to their size and cost, roller grinders are used exclusively by commercial and industrial scale coffee producers.</p>
            <p>Water-cooled roller grinders are used for high production rates as well as for fine grinds such as Turkish and espresso.</p>
