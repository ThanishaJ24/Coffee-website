        <h2>Coffee Roasting</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:30px">
            <b>Coffee roasting</b> , process by which the aromatic and gustatory qualities of coffee beans are developed at high temperatures. Roasted coffee beans can then be ground and brewed with water to make coffee drinks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coffee beans are seeds matured in coffee cherry. They are then processed and dried to coffee beans. Before roasting, coffee beans are green in color and have a beany and grassy aroma. Actually, green coffee beans do not smell like coffee at all. When we roast coffee, we develop 800 to 1000 different aroma compounds. These compounds make the flavour of the coffee. With roast profiling, we can affect the existence of these aroma compounds in coffee and also determine the flavour of the coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coffee roasting begins with green coffee beans, which themselves have been processed and dried. Temperatures are raised progressively from about 180 to 250 °C (356 to 482 °F) and heated for anywhere from 7 to 20 minutes, depending on the type of roast, light or dark, desired. Roasting releases steam, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other volatiles from the beans. If the beans are chemically decaffeinated, roasting also removes all but trace amounts of the solvent residues. Roasting results in a loss of weight between 14 and 23 percent, and the internal pressure of gas expands the coffee beans by 30–100 percent. The beans become a deep rich brown, and their texture becomes porous and crumbly under pressure. The most important effect of roasting is the appearance of the characteristic aroma of coffee, which arises from very complex chemical transformations within the bean. Roasting too long can destroy volatile flavour and aroma compounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of the method used, the coffee, after leaving industrial roasters, is rapidly cooled in a vat, where it is stirred and subjected to cold air propelled by a blower. Good-quality coffees are then sorted by electronic sorters to eliminate those beans, either too light or too dark, that roasted badly and whose presence downgrades the overall quality.

        <h2>Roasting Method</h2>
        <h2>Step 1: Extracting the coffee beans </h2>
        <p>Prior to roasting, the bean needs to be extracted from within the many layers of a coffee cherry. For coffee, we are only looking to extract and use the beans found in the centre (generally there are two coffee beans).The coffee cherry is made up approximately six layers. Starting with the outer skin, then the pulp, mucilage, parchment, silver-skin and the all-important beans in the middle
        </p>
        <h3>Understanding the 6 coffee layers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Outer Skin / Exocarp: Coffee seeds are covered by flesh, much like a cherry you might eat. At the beginning of fruit development, this outer layer of the coffee cherry is green. As the fruit matures, it turns yellow, then orange, and finally a ripe red.
            </li>

            <li>Pulp / Mucilage / Mesocarp:The next layer of the coffee cherry is common in many seeded fruits. It’s a sweet sticky layer covering each of the coffee seeds, rich in sugars and has a big influence on the taste of the coffee bean
            </li>

            <li>Pectin: This is responsible in protecting the coffee beans. It’s made up of a cellulose layer.</li>
            <li>Parchment / Endocarp: This is a thick shell-like layer that surrounds the bean and when dried, loosely resembles parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Silver Skin / Chaff: This is a very fine layer which has a silver sheen to it, which is where the name originates. This layer remains on the seeds (coffee beans) and is removed by the roasting process. It can often be referred to as chaff.</li>
            <li>Seed / Coffee Bean:The beautiful green coffee bean or seed, while still inside the cherry, matures to become the coffee we all know and love, once it’s roasted to perfection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 2: Preparing the coffee beans</h2>
        <p>Before the coffee beans are roasted, they must go through a special preparation stage, which can be done through either a washed process or a natural one.</p>
        <ul>
        <h3><li>Dry/Natural Coffee Process</li></h3>
        <p>Dry process, also known as unwashed or natural coffee, is the oldest method of processing coffee. The entire cherry after harvest is first cleaned and then placed in the sun to dry on tables or in thin layers on patios.</p>
        <h3><li>Wet/Washed Coffee Process</li></h3>
        <p>The washed process is where the beans are dried without the cherry, de-pulped and then they are usually fermented to help in separating the rest of the pectin from the bean and parchment, then finally, the beans will be washed and cleaned before drying.</p>
        <p>You may not think it, but this preparation before the roasting process does affect the taste! When dried naturally, you can expect fruitier flavours due to the fermentation of natural sugars in the pulp. A washed process however, offers more vibrant flavours. This is because it removes all the pulp and fruity sugars which have an impact on the bean, leaving the pure coffee bean flavour to come through and take centre stage.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 3: The roasting process</h2>
        <p>Interestingly, coffee beans aren’t just the wonderful rich, brown colour with the flavour and aroma we all cherish – they’re actually green to begin with and smell grassy! It’s the magic of the roasting process that we owe to the fantastic flavours and scents of the humble coffee bean.</p>
        <p>Once the beans are put inside the drum of the coffee roaster and they begin to heat up, the process causes a chemical change in the beans as they’re brought to a high temperature very quickly. Then, once they reach the ideal temperature for that particular roast, they get cooled rapidly in order to stop them being roasted further. The whole process may sound relatively simple, but it requires a keen eye to ensure they’re roasted to the correct standards.</p>
        <h3>Types of Coffee Roast</h3>
        
            <ol>
                <h3><li> Light roast coffee</li></h3>
                <p>Light roast coffee is also known as the first crack due to the fact that the beans are at the first stage of expanding and cracking.</p>
                <p>This type of coffee roast is when the beans reach an internal temperature of between 180°c - 205°c and are very light in colour and dry with absolutely no oil present on the surface. The flavour profile will be quite acidic but you’ll also expect fruity notes and a more aromatic experience too.</p>
                <h3><li> Medium roast coffee</li></h3>
                <p>As the name suggests, medium roast coffee is medium brown in colour, dry and generally more balanced in flavour. This type of coffee roast is roasted to a temperature of between 210°C - 220°C and is preferred by many as the flavour, aroma and acidity all entwine in a harmonious blend and often, a slightly sweeter taste and stronger aroma can be expected too. </p>
                <h3><li> Medium-dark roast coffee</li></h3>
                <p>With the coffee beans reaching a temperature of between 225°c - 230°c, medium-dark roast coffee is a great option for those looking for something a little stronger in flavour than medium, but not quite as bitter as dark roast coffee. Darker in colour and with oil present on the surface of the roasted bean, this type offers a rich flavour that’s described as almost bittersweet. Additionally, thanks to the extended roasting period, the acidity is virtually undetectable. </p>
                <h3><li> Dark roast coffee</li></h3>
                <p>The boldest roasting profile available, dark roast coffee is roasted to a temperature of between 240°c - 250°c. This type is black in colour with an oily surface and a very bitter taste. The flavours are very pronounced with strong notes and often, hints of caramel can be found in these types of coffee roast. </p>
            </ol>
